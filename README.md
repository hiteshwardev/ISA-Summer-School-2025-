# Data-Driven Astronomy Internship Projects

## 📌 Overview
This repository contains **two astronomy research projects** completed as part of a
**Data-Driven Astronomy internship** at **India Space Academy – Summer School 2025**.

These projects were developed earlier during the internship period but are being
**uploaded to GitHub at a later stage for documentation, reproducibility, and
portfolio purposes**.

Both projects apply observational data analysis and statistical techniques to address
fundamental problems in modern astrophysics and cosmology.

## 📂 Projects Included

### 🔭 Project 1: Dynamical Mass Estimation of a Galaxy Cluster
**Using Spectroscopic Redshift Data**

#### Objective
To estimate the **dynamical mass of a galaxy cluster** using spectroscopic redshift
measurements and galaxy kinematics.

#### Key Methods
- Cluster identification via redshift overdensity
- Relativistic Doppler velocity calculation
- Velocity dispersion estimation
- Physical size determination using ΛCDM cosmology
- Virial theorem–based mass estimation

#### Key Result
- Estimated dynamical mass:  
  \[
  M_{dyn} \sim 10^{14} M_\odot
  \]
- Confirms strong **dark matter domination**
